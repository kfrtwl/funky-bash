Funky Theme for Bash

(Converted from ZSH theme by me)

ZSH Source: https://tsdh.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/my-funky-zsh-prompt/

# Reasoning

Fell into the zsh trap when I started to learn linux. After a bit of research I found out that bash was the main shell for the career I want to get into. When my favorite zsh theme, Funky, was not on bash. I went out to translate it from zsh to bash. :)

# Needs fixing
- ~~smiley face not outputting properly~~ :)
- ~~status not properly displaying -- currently working on~~
- history increments randomly instead of linearly -- currently working on
